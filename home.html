                    ChickenBus is a mobile application that allows users to search for fun and interesting locations around them. The company is a student-ran startup out of UNC and is seeking to work with more students to improve the product and service. Most importantly, ChickenBus relies on having accurate data on public transportation routes in lesser developed countries. We would like to "crowdsource" these data through an innovate serious game allowing users to like and share awesome locations around them, while providing information about how they got there for others to do the same. One of the most effective companies to have undertaken this challenge is the GPS app 'Waze,' but students will be given complete creative autonomy to come up with their own solution for ChickenBus.
