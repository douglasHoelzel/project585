                <p> ChickenBus is a website and mobile application that allows users to search for accurate public transportation routes in lesser-developed countries. The company is a student-ran startup out of UNC, and is seeking to work with more students to improve the product and service. Most importantly, ChickenBus relies on having accurate data on pubic transportation routes in lesser developed countries. We would like to “crowdfund” these data through an innovate serious game. One of the most effective companies to have undertaken this challenge is the GPS app ‘Waze,’ but students will be given complete creative autonomy to come up with their own solution for ChickenBus.
